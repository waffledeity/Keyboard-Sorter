Object: the object will be defined with four attributes
  Color : the color of the keycaps
  Noise : How loud the keyboard is
  SwitchType : The type of switched used on the keyboard
  CaseColor : The color of the case

For managing this list we are going to use:
  ArrayList for storing and quick addition/removal
  Hashmap for quick search

LinearSearch and Hashing will be used to sort it

The UI will be a CLI with a /help option to describe the functions
